# GETTING STARTED
## pre-requisites
In order to insure compatibility the following steps are required:  
- check the vivado version used by the [pynq project](https://github.com/xilinx/pynq), at the time of writing the compatible version is the 2022.1 but this could change in the future.  
- the same version should be used for the petalinux software, note that [petalinux only supports some linux distros](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/2022.1-English/ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide/Installation-Requirements"petalinux 2022.1 installation requirements"). For petalinux 2022.1 ubuntu 20.04 was used.
