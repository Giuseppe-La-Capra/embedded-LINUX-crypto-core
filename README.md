# GETTING STARTED
## pre-requisites
In order to insure compatibility the following steps are required:  
- check the vivado version used by the [pynq project](https://github.com/xilinx/pynq). At the time of writing the compatible version is the 2022.1 but this **could change in the future**.  
  - download and install the required version of the software from the [xilinx website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/vivado-design-tools/2022-1.html).
- the same version should be used for the petalinux software, note that [petalinux only supports some linux distros](https://docs.xilinx.com/r/2022.1-English/ug1144-petalinux-tools-reference-guide/Installation-Requirements "petalinux 2022.1 installation requirements"). For petalinux 2022.1 ubuntu 20.04 was used.  
  - make sure you read petalinux installation requirements carefully, expecially the free space requirement and the bin/sh shell requirement.  
  - download and install the petalinux software from the [xilinx website](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download/index.html/content/xilinx/en/downloadNav/embedded-design-tools/2022-1.html).  
  - make sure to install the required packages referenced in the excel file located in the [petalinux release notes webpage](https://support.xilinx.com/s/article/000033799?language=en_US) **for your installed version**.
